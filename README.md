# Spring-Bootchain
Blockchain API using Spring Boot

The plan is to learn bootchain by developing this project.

The project will involve the backedn processing server and a front end website that allows the user to make requests.

## The server:
- [ ] API server that allows the user to interact with the blockchain.
- [ ] The user can create an account with username and password.
- [ ] Have a wallet to store the fake currency.
- [ ] Make transactions to other users.
- [ ] Mine a block to record the transactions and this process will reward the miner with currency.

## The Website:
- [ ] Lets a user interact with the server.
- [ ] Login to the website.
- [ ] Enter data into forms to specifiy a transaction with another user.
### Mine a block:
- [ ] When the user wants to mine a block the website will display animations to explain what the server is doing to mine a block.
- [ ] The current nonce and hash will be displayed and the requirement of the hashcode will be above it.
- [ ] Not all hash codes will be displayed to the user, maybe like every 100th or every 1000th.
- [ ] The user interface should rapidly update to allow the user to see the hashcode for a brief second.
- [ ] Different colours will be used similar to wordle or whatever its called. To help the user understand the requirements of the hash code we are searching for.
